# header_pressure_impact

### Start with Tract 14

1) Compare every bhp gauge with header pressure at T14

2) Create a bhp vs liquid / oil correlation for each well

Run pull_tags then process then then welltests,  plot_wells

bhp_dict.csv in the pull_data folder has the tags for each JP, headerP represents the pad level
